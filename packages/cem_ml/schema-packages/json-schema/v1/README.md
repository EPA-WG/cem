# JSON Schema Resource Schema Package

This package defines registry identity for JSON Schema documents.

JSON Schema source is JSON text, not CEM-ML syntax. The schema package and this
manifest are authored in CEM-ML, but resources with the `application/schema+json`
content type are parsed as JSON and interpreted as JSON Schema vocabulary
documents.

## Owned Identities

- Schema URL: `https://cem.dev/ns/data/json-schema/1`
- Primary content type: `application/schema+json`
- Common file forms: `.schema.json`, `.jsonschema`

This package depends on the generic JSON package because JSON Schema documents
are JSON values first. It does not claim `application/json`; callers should use
`application/schema+json` or an explicit schema identity when the same bytes are
intended to be interpreted as a JSON Schema document.

## Resource Model

The schema describes the JSON Schema document model used by registry loaders and
tooling:

- schemas declare a dialect such as Draft 2020-12 through `$schema`;
- schema resources may carry `$id`, anchors, and dynamic anchors;
- `$ref` and `$dynamicRef` edges are URI references resolved by the loader;
- vocabularies define keyword sets and whether support is required;
- validation, applicator, annotation, format, and unevaluated keywords are kept
  distinct so engines can report unsupported vocabulary precisely.
