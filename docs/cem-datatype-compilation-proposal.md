# General datatype compilation proposal

Status: temporary design draft. Registered schema-owned implementations,
native `@rule` binding and separate validation/conversion roles are adopted.
Registry collision policy, exact signatures and remaining kind contracts need
decisions. General datatype compilation must be designed before enabling native attribute `@type` consumption.
This draft does not adopt a new executable grammar or enable datatype references.

## Problem and accepted boundary

The current schema document compiler constructs attributes and their local
facets. It does not construct a general executable model for schema `{types}`.
Several validators identify built-in types by the local part of a type name.
The separate native attribute conversion contract already supports a base model,
intersecting restrictions, and one final converted value.

Attribute `@type={#datatype}` adopts an explicit reference selecting one named
`{type}` declaration. The source declaration, its lexical schema and its owner
must remain retained. Compilation controls evaluation context and timing.
Source readiness guarding keeps this slot pending until its consumer exists;
malformed slots are errors. Literal type lookup remains compatible during the
transition. An unknown type must not become an untyped/string fallback.

The shipped vocabulary contains `lexical`, `scalar`, `list`, `grammar` and
`reference` kinds. Some `rule` values are names such as `local-name`; others are
prose such as `signed decimal integer`. List declarations use `base` for an item
shape, for example `name-list` with `base=identifier`. Those existing forms must
be inventoried and tested before claiming a general datatype compiler.

## Proposed compiled representation

Use a compiled datatype descriptor distinct from the source AST. It holds:

- The original retained declaration handle and declaring lexical bindings.
- A consumer-owned internal identity and public schema/type name when declared.
  Storage addresses are internal; contexts and scope roots need no authored ID.
- Its representation/conversion contract and its resolved base or item contract.
- Ordered restriction records with their original source attribution.
- Readiness, dependency issues and diagnostics, separately from available partial
  descriptors. Warning or ignored links remain incomplete.

Do not clone declarations into the consuming source document or flatten a
restriction chain into one overwritten facet set. Compiled scalar metadata may
be reused; reference and source identity remain original handles. Distinguish
conversion of scalar values from retained node validation.

## Compilation and reference evaluation

1. Collect declarations and lexical environments before binding dependencies.
   Preserve current collection precedence during migration. Decide duplicate
   datatype-name behavior explicitly before implementing a registry.
2. Bind literal local/QName names through the declaration's own schema and
   declared exports. Native selection uses the shared lifecycle resolver and
   requires exactly one named `{type}` target. Do not infer URL lookup or grants.
3. Build a bounded dependency graph without recursive source expansion. Bases,
   item contracts and native chains share the enclosing request and destination
   budgets, active link identities and explicit scope-crossing rules.
4. Classify each descriptor and check that all authored fields have a supported
   meaning. Never silently ignore an unsupported kind, rule or native edge.
5. Compose conversion and restrictions, check defaults when their effective type
   is ready, and publish schema/converters/artifacts together through existing
   package readiness rules. Keep the previous complete package active meanwhile.

Both literal lookup and native selection should eventually produce the same
compiled datatype descriptor. The legacy literal path remains explicit until
parity fixtures prove migration safe. A user declaration named `integer` must
not receive an intrinsic implementation merely because its local name matches.

## Proposed kind contracts

| Kind | Proposed meaning | Remaining design work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scalar` | One value with an explicit primitive conversion/validation contract and restrictions | Built-in registry binding, normalization and custom implementations |
| `lexical` | A value checked by a declared lexical predicate | Executable `rule` binding and compatibility with shipped descriptions |
| `list` | Ordered values satisfying an item datatype contract | Item representation, delimiter/normalization rules and the meaning of list `values` |
| `grammar` | A value checked by a declared grammar consumer | Binding to existing content-model parsers versus a new grammar language |
| `reference` | A symbolic-reference value contract such as a QName | Separate lexical validation from consumer-requested dereferencing; do not imply URL or AST link evaluation |
| Native node contracts | Retained node input consumed by native validation/behaviors | Preserve the existing explicit node contract and decide how it is represented in the datatype registry |

For inherited scalar restrictions, the recommendation is intersection: the base
and every restriction must hold, including locally authored attribute facets.
This agrees with `AttributeValueContract.restrictions`. Conversion occurs once;
restrictions cannot change the final representation. Type-dependent checks wait
while dependencies are pending; independent malformed rules or facet syntax can
still be reported. This recommendation is not yet a general datatype decision.

## Adopted executable rule approach

Bind executable semantics to explicitly registered schema-owned implementations,
using native predicates/parsers and schema behavior capabilities. Shipped prose
remains descriptive metadata attached to explicitly registered built-in contracts.
Neither a matching description nor a same-name vendor type acquires an intrinsic
implementation. Registration must retain its declaring identity and authorized
owner; unknown or unavailable implementations cannot activate a datatype.

Do not introduce an executable grammar language for `@rule`. Registered grammar
consumers may reuse existing content-model parsers. A source rule description is
not reparsed as executable code, and imported document formats continue to resolve
only at the retained CEM AST import boundary.

Registration supplies a capability, not a scope-crossing grant. Native binding
must obey the shared reference resolver's context, budget and permission rules.
Compilation checks the implementation's datatype compatibility and retains its
original declaration; rule execution happens when a consumer validates or
converts a value. Exact typed input/result signatures still need specification.

## Adopted custom binding in source

An explicit native `@rule={#behavior}` selects exactly one named `{behavior}`
declaration with a registered datatype-compatible implementation. Literal `@rule`
values keep their descriptive role. The explicit constructor distinguishes
executable binding from prose without adding a second field or making strings
implicit references. A separate `@behavior` attribute is not adopted.

The compiler must retain the selected behavior's original owner, lexical schema,
signature and source maps. Selection, intermediate references and related datatype
dependencies share the enclosing compilation traversal. Missing context, denied
crossings and bounded/cyclic chains keep the descriptor pending or unresolved
according to effective scope policy; malformed targets and complete zero/multiple
selections are schema errors. Selecting a behavior does not import its entire
schema or authorize arbitrary code execution.

This binding is designed but not enabled. The metamodel admission contract,
registered implementation signature and lifecycle adapter must be specified
before implementation. Generic CEM-ML parsing still only retains reference nodes;
the datatype consumer owns the behavior-target and signature checks.

## Adopted validation and conversion roles

`@rule` validates the consumer-supplied value and reports
acceptance or diagnostics. Conversion/normalization is a separate registered
datatype capability that produces one canonical value when the consumer explicitly
requests conversion. Rules and inherited/local restrictions check that value;
they cannot replace it. Validation alone does not invoke conversion implicitly.
This preserves the existing conversion-once restriction contract without limiting
which datatype kinds can obtain registered implementations.

A rule cannot return a replacement typed value or mutate an authored source node.
A conversion implementation needs its own typed signature and declared output
representation. Canonical values must still satisfy all inherited and local
restrictions. Conversion failure, invalid input, unavailable execution and
malformed implementation results remain distinct consumer outcomes.

The following are proposed semantic input roles, not enabled function names or
metamodel `source` literals:

| Role | Proposed typed input | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Candidate | Explicit retained native node | Original input/source provenance and allowed candidate navigation |
| Datatype | Original retained `{type}` declaration | Declaring identity and source contract without a copied record |
| Value | Representation declared by the datatype kind: scalar, ordered items or retained nodes | The consumer's current value, with authored source still retained |
| Context | Runtime-supplied evaluation frame | Evaluation time/scope and access grants, without an authored root ID |

The adapter must reject incompatible signatures before rule execution. Existing
legacy `object` candidates do not substitute for explicit native node parameters.
The result protocol must distinguish invalid input from pending/unavailable
execution and malformed implementation results. Scalar extraction, normalization
and node resolution remain explicit consumer operations. No role permits ambient
URL handling or wider source navigation than the consumer grants.

Exact input/result bindings follow the selected validation/conversion contract.
Duplicate names, scalar restriction composition, list representation and
kind-specific grammar/reference behavior remain separate explicit TODO items.

## Next decision: datatype registry collisions

Bind names in the declaring lexical schema, using its local declarations and
explicit namespace aliases/exports. An internal scope handle is given by the
compiler/runtime; it does not require an authored root ID. Original declaration
owners remain part of dependency and implementation identity. Matching a local
name never substitutes for an explicitly registered implementation.

Recommended collision policy: two distinct declarations claiming the same
scoped datatype name are a compilation error. Reuse of the same original
declaration from multiple attribute sites remains valid. Equal local names in
separate lexical scopes/namespaces are independent and require the normal
explicit boundary contracts to be selected across scopes. Registered package
replacement still uses its origin/grant and coordinated activation rules.

Alternative collision policy: later distinct declarations replace earlier ones,
following existing element/attribute collection precedence. This makes the
binding order part of a datatype's effective validation contract; the registry
would need to retain shadowing provenance and make that order explicit.

No datatype registry is enabled yet. Select the collision policy before defining
its collection/name-binding implementation. List representations, exact rule
signatures and other kind-specific contracts remain separate action items.

## Verified inventory and current native boundary

The Rust inventory retains the original AST owners for all 18 declarations in
`cem-ml-generic.cem`. It confirms four lexical, nine scalar, two list, one grammar
and two symbolic-reference declarations. `name-list` and `wildcard-name-list`
have item bases; `type-reference` has `qualified-name` as a symbolic value base.
Named and prose `rule` values coexist in the same shipped vocabulary.

| Current surface | Evidence | Compiler implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shipped string/boolean/integer/number conversion | Native conversion outputs pass the existing schema validator | Reuse these explicit conversion contracts, preserving normalization |
| Lexical, URI/semver/media-type/path, list, grammar and symbolic-reference conversion | Standalone conversion rejects the inventoried unsupported examples | Supply registered implementations; do not default them to strings |
| Native node attributes | Existing retained validation uses explicit node contracts; scalar conversion rejects nodes | Keep a distinct retained-input contract |
| Literal schema validation | Existing predicates recognize additional built-in names | Predicate availability alone does not establish a conversion implementation |

This is a migration baseline, not parity for every datatype. Conversion may
accept alternative lexical forms and produce a canonical value: for example,
boolean conversion maps `1` to `true`, while direct schema validation requires
its existing lexical contract. Validation and explicit conversion remain distinct
consumer operations. Full kind-specific parity and rule-registration fixtures
remain required before replacing legacy lookup or enabling native `@type`.

## Implementation sequence after decisions

The actionable steps and adjacent verification scenarios are in
[todo.md](todo.md#general-datatype-compilation-design).
Start with an inventory of existing declarations and native contract parity,
then establish the descriptor and lexical registry, bind dependency graphs,
implement kind consumers, and finally enable native attribute type consumption.
Keep function reference contracts, child-scope override syntax, and
`cem-element` ID conversion on their existing deferred tracks.
