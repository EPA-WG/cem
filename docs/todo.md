# Todo

This file is the authoritative checklist for active execution work.
Product/module sequencing lives in [roadmap.md](../roadmap.md), and future
wishlist work lives in [wishlist.md](wishlist.md).

Completed datatype/reference contracts, native-surface capabilities, component
migrations and verification evidence are preserved in the
[2026-10-10 snapshot](archive/todo-snapshot-2026-10-10.md). Its checkbox states are
historical; only the unfinished actions below govern execution. Adopted contracts
remain in their design documents. Earlier history is linked from the snapshot.

## Current work: Declarative Amsterdam 2026 CEM presentation

Priority switch requested 2026-10-10. Until the presentation is ready, `continue`
means the next unfinished presentation action in this section. Read the
[presentation handoff](presentation/declarative-amsterdam-2026-handoff.md) after
clearing chat context; it records the starting material, implementation
checkpoint and return path. The existing
[session proposal](declarative.amsterdam.2026.md) is the starting brief. The
[working presentation document](declarative-amsterdam-2026/presentation.md)
records the 2026-10-10 public-source review, earlier tutorial outline and
remaining correspondence/release checks. On 2026-10-10 the user changed the
direction to an adoption-focused platform pitch: establish the CEM manifesto
and platform pitch first, then map those into the website and presentation.
The syntax-led tutorial outline is historical input, not the active narrative.
The [presentation plan](declarative-amsterdam-2026/presentation-plan.md) owns
design and adoption planning; the
[platform pitch](declarative-amsterdam-2026/cem-platform-pitch.md) owns the
audience-facing message. This file remains the sole execution checklist.

- [x] Write the CEM manifesto and platform pitch around audience outcomes,
      declarative embeddable applications, cross-language data neutrality and
      evolutionary architecture. Ground the security story in slide 6 of the
      supplied DCE deck; distinguish current controls from complete vendor
      isolation. Record schema inventory, demonstrations and claim evidence.
      Saved in [manifesto](declarative-amsterdam-2026/cem-manifesto.md), [platform pitch](declarative-amsterdam-2026/cem-platform-pitch.md)
      and [evidence record](declarative-amsterdam-2026/platform-evidence.md).
      Documentation/source audit only; new demonstrations and benchmarks remain
      unimplemented and unverified.
- [x] Review EPA-concept and DWA as idea sources, not implementation guides.
      Incorporated independent ownership/releases, explicit effects, multiple
      presentation contexts and a proposed version-adapter proof into the
      manifesto/pitch; recorded source links and non-adopted assumptions in the
      evidence record. No implementation contracts or fixtures changed.
- [x] Compare the pitch opening with the official
      [Java EE introduction](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/overview.htm).
      Rewrite the opening and spoken pitch around the target market, delivery
      and integration costs, security/performance goals, and CEM's distinctive
      embeddability and independent evolution proposition.
- [x] Broaden the pitch beyond web applications to data processing services and
      pipelines with multiple sources and outputs. Align the manifesto, CLI
      and library use cases, audience priorities, and proposed demonstration;
      record the supported engine/graph entry points and host responsibilities.
- [x] Ground the enterprise transformation-service pitch in the Intel/SOA and
      appliance precedent. Explain format and location independence through
      adapter/resolver boundaries; add a proposed location-change proof and
      state extensible, customizable connectors as a platform capability,
      separately from format adapters and appliance comparisons.
- [x] Reframe security around runtime insulation of each vendor's application,
      pipeline stage, and connector. Promote the six layers (Memory, Storage,
      CPU, DOM, CSS, Network) to a main pitch promise; distinguish declarations,
      host grants, and enforced boundaries. Explain nested safeguards and
      budgets, with per-layer evidence and observable demonstration criteria.
- [x] Replace the engine's implementation-starting-point paragraph with the
      full SDLC proposition: source/type selection, schema reuse, extension, or creation,
      module reuse/development, composition, debugging, testing, packaging,
      browser/server/CI execution, operation, and evolution. Connect these
      stages through shared contracts and diagnostics; align the proposed demo.
- [x] Separate the internal presentation plan from the audience-facing platform
      pitch. Preserve audience strategy, proof design, adoption criteria and
      preparation requirements in the plan; rewrite the pitch as public copy
      and update document references to reflect their distinct purposes.
- [x] Tighten the full platform pitch to the user's concise, easy-to-scan style.
      Preserve its message and capability boundaries; record this style in the
      presentation plan for slides, website, and spoken copy.
- [x] Align schema choices across the pitch, manifesto, plan, and evidence:
      pick, extend, or create your own schemas. Retain all three in future copy.
- [ ] Use the presentation plan to map the manifesto and platform pitch into
      the presentation website and revised slide narrative. Use familiar
      side-by-side representations and
      visible outcomes; prioritize XML/XSLT developers, web UI developers and
      platform/integration owners. Keep the 60-minute published slot while
      replacing the syntax-lesson framing.

- [ ] Reconcile the session proposal and earlier drafts with current CEM
      implementation. Establish audience, learning outcomes, accepted duration,
      delivery format and review requirements. Use the published 60-minute
      slot and revised adoption-focused pitch as the working baseline; verify conference details
      and release availability before presenting them as confirmed.
      Public program placement and implementation boundaries are recorded in the
      working presentation document; Gmail history, final organizer requirements
      and participant release availability remain unresolved.
- [x] Develop the timed narrative and slide outline around one document's
      validation, inspection, source-linked diagnostics, conversion,
      query/transformation and light-DOM rendering. Connect the exercise to the
      wider CEM platform and distinguish implemented capabilities from plans.
      Earlier tutorial outline completed in the working presentation document;
      superseded as the active narrative by the manifesto/pitch direction above.
- [ ] Prepare a reproducible tutorial and presenter demo with source files,
      exact commands, expected results, an intentional error and repair, and a
      presenter-led fallback. Reuse current examples and native capabilities;
      add an explicit fixture action here before any new fixture work.
- [ ] Produce the presentation, speaker notes, diagrams and participant setup
      instructions. Check the proposed Node/Linux installation paths against
      actual available releases, and record requirements for any other platforms
      included in the session.
- [ ] Rehearse the timed walkthrough and verify every shown command, example,
      output and demo path. Check slide readability and the fallback flow;
      record the tested versions and remaining limitations with the materials.
- [ ] Finalize the presentation and supporting files, record their locations
      and verification in the handoff, and archive completed presentation actions.
      Then continue with **CEM Studio** below. An outline alone does not complete
      this set.

## Next priority: CEM Studio

CEM Studio follows the presentation goals, before the preserved implementation
queue.

- [ ] Review CEM Studio's current implementation against the
      [Studio contract](cem-studio.md) and
      [package status](../packages/cem-studio/README.md). Define its next delivery
      milestone and add the remaining implementation and verification steps here.

The implementation sections below are preserved for resumption after the
presentation and CEM Studio goals. Their 16 open actions, conditional boundaries
and verification requirements remain in force; this priority switch completes
none of them. Their recommended-next labels apply when that queue resumes.

## Declarative UI Architecture Correction

### Remaining declarative UI migration

Current inventory: **20 canonical / 33 legacy components / 53 legacy authored
code files**. Follow the [declarative UI principle](declarative-ui-principle.md)
and [component development pattern](component-development-pattern.md).

- [ ] **Recommended next: migrate cem-datepicker**, starting with a native
      fixture for its recorded template-brace defect. Preserve keyboard, value,
      form and reset contracts in colocated stories and source/packed galleries;
      add generic runtime capability where declaration support is missing.
- [ ] Migrate cem-timepicker and cem-slider, preserving native editor/range
      ownership, value, form, reset and interaction contracts.
- [ ] Migrate navigation and interactive content owners, including cem-nav,
      cem-tabs, cem-stepper, cem-tree, cem-list and cem-chip; resolve their
      recorded presence/focus failures through the adopted owner contracts.
- [ ] Finish every remaining legacy member as
      `src/components/<cem-tag>/<cem-tag>.xhtml`, with embedded once-per-declaration
      scoped CEM-token CSS and colocated CSF Next `.stories.ts` play tests.
      Move missing reusable behavior into `cem-elements`, ship property pages
      and five-theme galleries, and verify source, bundle and packed consumers.
      Reduce both legacy component and authored-code counts to zero.
- [ ] Re-establish the remaining legacy browser failure baseline and repair
      shared semantics or migrate owners without weakening assertions. Rebuild
      `cem-elements` first because the suite imports its packaged output.
      The [failure inventory](cem-components-baseline-2026-09-27.md) records the
      historical 81 passing / 48 failing comparison against commit `5f8e7172`;
      subsequent migrations resolved some cases. Focused passing migrations do
      not establish a green full legacy package gate.
- [ ] Migrate remaining Studio and Site visible DOM construction, UI listeners
      and state projection to XHTML/CEM-ML, retaining JavaScript only for non-UI
      services and host adapters.

### Native-surface delivery follow-ups

- [ ] Verify both pinned [ARIA profiles](cem-element-aria-reference-profile.md)
      in the documented browser/assistive-technology matrix. Record actual
      browser/OS/AT versions, accessibility relation exposure, ordered/repeated
      details targets and error-message announcements. Keep untested combinations
      explicit and the draft profile opt-in. Single-relation accessibility APIs
      may expose only the first target; exported DOM sequences must stay intact.

## Autocomplete and suggestions design for CEM inputs

The shared controller, declarative field composition, native profiles and
host-integrated fixtures are implemented. Remaining acceptance uses the
[suggestions acceptance record](../packages/cem-components/docs/suggestions-acceptance.md)
and its repeatable device procedures; automated input does not establish
physical-device or spoken assistive-technology coverage.

- [ ] Complete physical touch/pen, real keyboard/IME, screen-reader and mobile
      viewport runs for both field providers. Record browser/OS/device/AT versions
      and exact outcomes. Verify tap preserves the editor/caret, pan scrolls,
      terminal IME keys neither select nor submit, and active-row/status
      announcements preserve the field's label/help. Run the plain overflow-box
      touch baseline: the automated gesture did not scroll it in this environment,
      and a wheel-scroll pass does not substitute for touch-pan evidence.
- [ ] Record supported-browser native datalist selection, filtering,
      accessibility and device evidence before claiming additional-profile
      acceptance. Demonstrate numeric option selection stores/submits `1` rather
      than its label One; cover email/URL sanitization, range/step mismatches,
      source withdrawal, physical IME and mobile keyboard/AT. Headed Chromium
      and Firefox probes recorded value/FormData and withdrawal, but did not
      establish visible picker selection; numeric Arrow Down/Enter produced `0`.
      WebKit probes remain blocked by missing host libraries. A connected list
      alone is not selection evidence; unsupported native UI preserves ordinary
      editing without a custom popup fallback.
- [ ] Record supported-device Back/dismiss-gesture evidence before advertising
      platform close support. Use the host-enabled acceptance procedure; the
      ordinary local gallery supplies no platform-close authority. Verify one
      accepted request dismisses the admitted child, preserves text and parent
      state, and releases the watcher so normal navigation resumes. Existing
      Chromium protocol evidence does not establish physical Back/gesture support.
- [ ] **Only when requested:** design field-owned label/submission conversion,
      multiline/email-multiple token completion and full surface-provider
      adoption. Carry explicit value/provenance, selection/history, native
      semantics and relationship grants into each separate contract. Labels must
      not rewrite numeric values; token edits must preserve caret, separators and
      composition; one provider owns each adopted surface.

## Browser failures observed during placement verification

Preserve meaningful assertions and existing story/global deadlines. Capture
failing lifecycle state before changing readiness or runtime behavior; passing
repeats alone do not attribute a historical failure.

- [ ] Fixture: attribute the historical aggregate-only data-table/set-URL and
      native suggestions pointer-tap deadlines recorded on 2026-10-08. Establish
      isolated controls, then capture the failing step under load. The separate
      pan-opening readiness defect and provider story split are complete; the
      final aggregate passed 487/487. Retain every tap, pan-cancellation and
      outside-focus assertion. See the
      [archived investigation](archive/todo-snapshot-2026-10-10.md#browser-failures-observed-during-placement-verification).
- [ ] Investigate runtime aggregate instability on recurrence. The historical
      action-cutover run passed 311/312 stories: `Payload Css Readiness And
      Hydration` expected one style but observed zero; its complete 12-story
      file passed in isolation. Later reader-admission fixture corrections do
      not attribute a post-settlement missing style. A full playground run on
      2026-10-10 also hit the gallery sample-readiness deadline once; all 19
      galleries passed in isolation and the complete source/packed rerun passed.
      Use the verifier's component, URL, missing-host and runtime diagnostics;
      preserve the readiness assertion and reproduce before changing behavior.

## Immediate: Legacy Demo Case Coverage

The static readiness inventory and reproduced scoped-CSS, external-src, retry,
NPM and string-demo fixture corrections are complete. Remaining work is traced
recurrence attribution, not wholesale replacement of frame waits. See the
[current boundary inventory](browser-stabilization-review.tmp.md#reconciliation-of-the-remaining-readiness-inventory).
The approved sequencing permits component migration while these historical
investigations remain open.

- [ ] Attribute the source-loaded cell-overrides stock sample's historical
      initial-warning timeout on traced recurrence. Retain its diagnostic target
      and current deadline. After refreshing packaged WASM, all 32 concurrent
      helper/real-component probes passed on 2026-10-08; warning publication took
      5.65–9.35 seconds under overlapping load without reproducing the failure.
- [ ] Capture declaration/render/worker state on recurrence of the location
      samples' 180-frame wait for both readers. Focused overlapping load passes
      without attributing the historical failure. Preserve exact per-card output
      and resource predicates; inspect authored instances and available lifecycle
      signals before changing the fixture. See the
      [NPM/location evidence](browser-stabilization-review.tmp.md#npm-and-location-readiness-under-overlapping-load).
- [ ] Capture HTTP's historical 300-frame initial article-count timeout using
      the existing opt-in lifecycle/per-card tracing, which rethrows the original
      error. Distinguish declaration/library startup, current rendering and
      future HTTP completion before choosing a correction. If startup polling
      is premature, await existing lifecycle settlement before checking each
      authored instance; preserve resource assertions and the 30-second story
      deadline. Traced follow-up workloads pass without reproducing the failure;
      see the [HTTP observation](browser-stabilization-review.tmp.md#http-startup-observation-without-a-reproduced-failure).

## Deferred Roadmap Work

The Edge/SSR host fixtures belong to Phase 3.5 after the browser substrate is
stable. Moving `@epa-wg/custom-element` into the monorepo and deciding final
legacy XSLT preservation belong to Phase 3.6. Swift/Xcode plus Kotlin/Compose
compile gates remain Phase 8. Live Figma UI Kit and prototype work is deferred
until final [Phases 10 and 11](../roadmap.md#phase-10---figma-ui-kit). Their
checklists live only in the roadmap. Finish and verify `cem-elements` and the
declarative `cem-components` migration first, then the remaining non-Figma phases
through Phase 9 release governance.
