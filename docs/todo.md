# Todo

This file tracks remaining execution tasks only. Product/module sequencing lives in
[`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md). Future wishlist work lives in
[`wishlist.md`](wishlist.md). Completed implementation history belongs in git
history.

## Immediate Goal

Phase 2 exit criteria from [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) are closed: the
parser/runtime report-consumer slice, browser runtime proof, stable chunked
binary handoff, embedded-payload handoff coverage, and web-host coordinate
projection have all passed their focused and gate verification. Continue with
Phase 3 substrate expansion.

Current active slice: add focused unit/browser fixtures for declaration
registration, payload capture, attribute invalidation, and data-island
isolation using the existing `cem-elements` test harness.

### Phase 3 Custom-Element Runtime

- [x] Audit the existing `@epa-wg/cem-elements` substrate implementation,
      parity inventories, Storybook fixtures, and Nx verification targets
      against the Phase 3.1 exit criteria from `roadmap.md`.
- [x] Tighten inline declaration shape validation to match
      `docs/cem-element-design.md`: inline declarations require exactly one
      direct-child WHATWG `<template>`, `src` declarations must not include an
      inline template, live declaration content is rejected, and the current
      implicit CEM-ML fallback path is removed or converted into an explicit
      diagnostic.
- [x] Promote the first executable browser substrate contract into one focused
      runtime story/fixture for inline `<cem-element>` declarations: exactly
      one inert declaration template, produced custom-element registration,
      captured instance data-island payload, visible light-DOM render
      ownership, and source-map fidelity labels on rendered nodes.
- [ ] Add focused unit/browser fixtures for declaration registration, payload
      capture, attribute invalidation, and data-island isolation using the
      existing `cem-elements` test harness.
- [ ] Verify with the focused `cem-elements` unit target first, then the
      Storybook browser target, substrate, legacy/material parity, demo
      fixture, and full `cem-elements:verify` gates that cover the touched
      runtime path.

### Next Work Item

Add focused unit/browser fixtures for the runtime behaviors that sit behind the
new inline substrate contract:

- keep the new `InlineBrowserSubstrateContract` story as the smoke fixture for
  strict inline declarations, registration, payload capture, light-DOM render
  ownership, and source-map/render metadata;
- add or tighten focused coverage for attribute invalidation so host attribute
  mutations after first render are proven against the same inline declaration
  contract, not only the broader render-loop story;
- add a small unit-level shape/registration fixture if useful so missing,
  duplicate, and live-content declaration errors are covered outside Storybook
  as well as in the browser harness;
- avoid broad legacy/material parity changes unless a focused fixture exposes a
  runtime regression;
- verify with `yarn nx run cem-elements:test:unit`,
  `yarn nx run cem-elements:test`, and then the full
  `yarn nx run cem-elements:verify` gate.

## Current Verification Commands

- `yarn nx run @epa-wg/cem-theme:verify:phase13`
- `yarn nx run cem-elements:test:unit`
- `yarn nx run cem-elements:test`
- `yarn nx run cem-elements:verify-substrate`
- `yarn nx run cem-elements:verify`
- `yarn nx run @epa-wg/cem-components:verify`
- `yarn nx run cem-elements:verify-edge-ssr`
- `yarn nx run @epa-wg/custom-element:verify`

## Externally Gated

These are intentionally not active in the current workspace because the required native toolchains are unavailable.
Keep the existing offline platform artifact validation as the release gate until supported native CI exists.

- Swift/Xcode compile gate for `packages/cem-theme/dist/lib/token-platforms/ios/CEMTokens.swift`.
- Kotlin/Compose Gradle compile gate for `packages/cem-theme/dist/lib/token-platforms/android/`.
