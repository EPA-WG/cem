# Todo

This file is the authoritative checklist for active execution work.
Product/module sequencing lives in [roadmap.md](../roadmap.md), and future
wishlist work lives in [wishlist.md](wishlist.md).

Completed datatype/reference contracts, native-surface capabilities, component
migrations and verification evidence are preserved in the
[2026-10-10 snapshot](archive/todo-snapshot-2026-10-10.md). Its checkbox states are
historical; only the unfinished actions below govern execution. Adopted contracts
remain in their design documents. Earlier history is linked from the snapshot.

## Declarative UI Architecture Correction

### Remaining declarative UI migration

Current inventory: **20 canonical / 33 legacy components / 53 legacy authored
code files**. Follow the [declarative UI principle](declarative-ui-principle.md)
and [component development pattern](component-development-pattern.md).

- [ ] **Recommended next: migrate cem-datepicker**, starting with a native
      fixture for its recorded template-brace defect. Preserve keyboard, value,
      form and reset contracts in colocated stories and source/packed galleries;
      add generic runtime capability where declaration support is missing.
- [ ] Migrate cem-timepicker and cem-slider, preserving native editor/range
      ownership, value, form, reset and interaction contracts.
- [ ] Migrate navigation and interactive content owners, including cem-nav,
      cem-tabs, cem-stepper, cem-tree, cem-list and cem-chip; resolve their
      recorded presence/focus failures through the adopted owner contracts.
- [ ] Finish every remaining legacy member as
      `src/components/<cem-tag>/<cem-tag>.xhtml`, with embedded once-per-declaration
      scoped CEM-token CSS and colocated CSF Next `.stories.ts` play tests.
      Move missing reusable behavior into `cem-elements`, ship property pages
      and five-theme galleries, and verify source, bundle and packed consumers.
      Reduce both legacy component and authored-code counts to zero.
- [ ] Re-establish the remaining legacy browser failure baseline and repair
      shared semantics or migrate owners without weakening assertions. Rebuild
      `cem-elements` first because the suite imports its packaged output.
      The [failure inventory](cem-components-baseline-2026-09-27.md) records the
      historical 81 passing / 48 failing comparison against commit `5f8e7172`;
      subsequent migrations resolved some cases. Focused passing migrations do
      not establish a green full legacy package gate.
- [ ] Migrate remaining Studio and Site visible DOM construction, UI listeners
      and state projection to XHTML/CEM-ML, retaining JavaScript only for non-UI
      services and host adapters.

### Native-surface delivery follow-ups

- [ ] Verify both pinned [ARIA profiles](cem-element-aria-reference-profile.md)
      in the documented browser/assistive-technology matrix. Record actual
      browser/OS/AT versions, accessibility relation exposure, ordered/repeated
      details targets and error-message announcements. Keep untested combinations
      explicit and the draft profile opt-in. Single-relation accessibility APIs
      may expose only the first target; exported DOM sequences must stay intact.

## Autocomplete and suggestions design for CEM inputs

The shared controller, declarative field composition, native profiles and
host-integrated fixtures are implemented. Remaining acceptance uses the
[suggestions acceptance record](../packages/cem-components/docs/suggestions-acceptance.md)
and its repeatable device procedures; automated input does not establish
physical-device or spoken assistive-technology coverage.

- [ ] Complete physical touch/pen, real keyboard/IME, screen-reader and mobile
      viewport runs for both field providers. Record browser/OS/device/AT versions
      and exact outcomes. Verify tap preserves the editor/caret, pan scrolls,
      terminal IME keys neither select nor submit, and active-row/status
      announcements preserve the field's label/help. Run the plain overflow-box
      touch baseline: the automated gesture did not scroll it in this environment,
      and a wheel-scroll pass does not substitute for touch-pan evidence.
- [ ] Record supported-browser native datalist selection, filtering,
      accessibility and device evidence before claiming additional-profile
      acceptance. Demonstrate numeric option selection stores/submits `1` rather
      than its label One; cover email/URL sanitization, range/step mismatches,
      source withdrawal, physical IME and mobile keyboard/AT. Headed Chromium
      and Firefox probes recorded value/FormData and withdrawal, but did not
      establish visible picker selection; numeric Arrow Down/Enter produced `0`.
      WebKit probes remain blocked by missing host libraries. A connected list
      alone is not selection evidence; unsupported native UI preserves ordinary
      editing without a custom popup fallback.
- [ ] Record supported-device Back/dismiss-gesture evidence before advertising
      platform close support. Use the host-enabled acceptance procedure; the
      ordinary local gallery supplies no platform-close authority. Verify one
      accepted request dismisses the admitted child, preserves text and parent
      state, and releases the watcher so normal navigation resumes. Existing
      Chromium protocol evidence does not establish physical Back/gesture support.
- [ ] **Only when requested:** design field-owned label/submission conversion,
      multiline/email-multiple token completion and full surface-provider
      adoption. Carry explicit value/provenance, selection/history, native
      semantics and relationship grants into each separate contract. Labels must
      not rewrite numeric values; token edits must preserve caret, separators and
      composition; one provider owns each adopted surface.

## Browser failures observed during placement verification

Preserve meaningful assertions and existing story/global deadlines. Capture
failing lifecycle state before changing readiness or runtime behavior; passing
repeats alone do not attribute a historical failure.

- [ ] Fixture: attribute the historical aggregate-only data-table/set-URL and
      native suggestions pointer-tap deadlines recorded on 2026-10-08. Establish
      isolated controls, then capture the failing step under load. The separate
      pan-opening readiness defect and provider story split are complete; the
      final aggregate passed 487/487. Retain every tap, pan-cancellation and
      outside-focus assertion. See the
      [archived investigation](archive/todo-snapshot-2026-10-10.md#browser-failures-observed-during-placement-verification).
- [ ] Investigate runtime aggregate instability on recurrence. The historical
      action-cutover run passed 311/312 stories: `Payload Css Readiness And
      Hydration` expected one style but observed zero; its complete 12-story
      file passed in isolation. Later reader-admission fixture corrections do
      not attribute a post-settlement missing style. A full playground run on
      2026-10-10 also hit the gallery sample-readiness deadline once; all 19
      galleries passed in isolation and the complete source/packed rerun passed.
      Use the verifier's component, URL, missing-host and runtime diagnostics;
      preserve the readiness assertion and reproduce before changing behavior.

## Immediate: Legacy Demo Case Coverage

The static readiness inventory and reproduced scoped-CSS, external-src, retry,
NPM and string-demo fixture corrections are complete. Remaining work is traced
recurrence attribution, not wholesale replacement of frame waits. See the
[current boundary inventory](browser-stabilization-review.tmp.md#reconciliation-of-the-remaining-readiness-inventory).
The approved sequencing permits component migration while these historical
investigations remain open.

- [ ] Attribute the source-loaded cell-overrides stock sample's historical
      initial-warning timeout on traced recurrence. Retain its diagnostic target
      and current deadline. After refreshing packaged WASM, all 32 concurrent
      helper/real-component probes passed on 2026-10-08; warning publication took
      5.65–9.35 seconds under overlapping load without reproducing the failure.
- [ ] Capture declaration/render/worker state on recurrence of the location
      samples' 180-frame wait for both readers. Focused overlapping load passes
      without attributing the historical failure. Preserve exact per-card output
      and resource predicates; inspect authored instances and available lifecycle
      signals before changing the fixture. See the
      [NPM/location evidence](browser-stabilization-review.tmp.md#npm-and-location-readiness-under-overlapping-load).
- [ ] Capture HTTP's historical 300-frame initial article-count timeout using
      the existing opt-in lifecycle/per-card tracing, which rethrows the original
      error. Distinguish declaration/library startup, current rendering and
      future HTTP completion before choosing a correction. If startup polling
      is premature, await existing lifecycle settlement before checking each
      authored instance; preserve resource assertions and the 30-second story
      deadline. Traced follow-up workloads pass without reproducing the failure;
      see the [HTTP observation](browser-stabilization-review.tmp.md#http-startup-observation-without-a-reproduced-failure).

## Deferred Roadmap Work

The Edge/SSR host fixtures belong to Phase 3.5 after the browser substrate is
stable. Moving `@epa-wg/custom-element` into the monorepo and deciding final
legacy XSLT preservation belong to Phase 3.6. Swift/Xcode plus Kotlin/Compose
compile gates remain Phase 8. Live Figma UI Kit and prototype work is deferred
until final [Phases 10 and 11](../roadmap.md#phase-10---figma-ui-kit). Their
checklists live only in the roadmap. Finish and verify `cem-elements` and the
declarative `cem-components` migration first, then the remaining non-Figma phases
through Phase 9 release governance.
