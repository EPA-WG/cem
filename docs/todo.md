# Todo

This file tracks remaining execution tasks only. Product/module sequencing lives in
[`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md). Future wishlist work lives in [`wishlist.md`](wishlist.md). Completed implementation
history belongs in git history and the feature-specific docs linked from the roadmap.

## Immediate Release Queue

No open immediate-release tasks.

## Externally Gated

These are intentionally not active in the current workspace because the required native toolchains are unavailable.
Keep the existing offline platform artifact validation as the release gate until supported native CI exists.

- Swift/Xcode compile gate for `packages/cem-theme/dist/lib/token-platforms/ios/CEMTokens.swift`.
- Kotlin/Compose Gradle compile gate for `packages/cem-theme/dist/lib/token-platforms/android/`.
